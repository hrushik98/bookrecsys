There are 4 types of recommendation systems. Those are:

1. Popularity Based: This type of recommendation system just displays the top most books based on some formula.
ex: Top 50 books on Goodread

2. Content Based: This type displays the books based on the user's interests. ex: if the user is into the horror genre books, the system would recommend him books of that genre.

3. Collaborative Filter Recommendation System: Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

4. Hybrid based: it's a combination of all the above three.

For my project, I have implemented Popularity based and Collaborative based recommendation systems.

The Popularity based recommendation system displays the top 50 books that have at least 250 votes. The top 50 books are sorted by the mean rating values.

The Collaborative Filter recommendation system shows the user similar types of books. I have used the cosine similarity method from sklearn and found out the distances between the books and then sorted them by their distances and displayed the top 5 recommendations.
